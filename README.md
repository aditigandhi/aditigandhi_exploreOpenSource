# aditigandhi_exploreOpenSource
This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.

Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps? 

My response to the prompt is below: 
I think Delilah could start by including testimonials from those who use her app (in addition to adding more inclusive photos) to emphasize that her app is not centered around a specific demographic. Additionally, I would recommend she have an inclusivity statement in her app’s “About Us” page to directly counter this important issue. Focus on bettering the app’s representation by including a diverse group of people in the testimonials, pictures and leadership.

- Awesome idea to add in quotes from girls from different backgrounds! I think that would definitely help with the issue of diversity and inclusion.
